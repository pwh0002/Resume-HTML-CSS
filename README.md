# Implementing a Design
Covalence

## Info
* A web developer is very rarely a web designer
* Instead, a designer will typically send you a design pdf or other guide
* The designer will also provide you with any assets- icons, fonts, etc. that are necessary to implement the design

## Objectives
* Remember to set up a new project folder linked to a github repository. Copy this README file into it, along with the fonts and images asset folders.
* Take a look at the design located at [this address](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/H2A4K6WUD#/screens/215414516_Resume).
* Your goal is to implement this design in building a personal resume page for yourself.
  * Customize the info for yourself
  * List past places of employment along with brief job descriptions (in the section where you see Platypi, Leap Logic, etc)
    * Make the link icons display as indicated and make them link to the employer's web page (or some other page if N/A)
  * The image tiles can be whichever images you like and can link to past projects on the web or to your favorite web sites.
  * The form will not actually do anything
  * Note: The navbar items are links to named anchors on the page, not to other pages; you will just have one web page.
